**Program Name:** Machine Learning Model and Application Manager

**Purpose:** The program is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to manage machine learning models and applications. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, deleting, and cloning models and applications, as well as running applications with selected models.

**Key Features:**

1. **Model Management:** Users can add, edit, delete, and clone models, as well as view their properties.
2. **Application Management:** Users can add, edit, delete, and clone applications, as well as view their properties and run them with a selected model.
3. **Data Storage:** The program uses a data storage system that loads and manages data from two JSON files: "models.json" and "apps.json".
